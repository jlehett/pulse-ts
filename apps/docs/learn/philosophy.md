# Philosophy

Pulse focuses on clarity, composition, and performance.

- **Composition over inheritance**: Build behavior by composing small, focused pieces.
- **Functional Nodes**: Declarative nodes with hooks make state and side effects explicit.
- **Deterministic simulation**: A fixed update loop guarantees consistent logic.
- **Separation of concerns**: Data lives in Components, logic in Systems, utilities in Services.
- **Performance by design**: Cached transforms, minimal allocations, and efficient queries.
- **Modular ecosystem**: Core stays lean; input, rendering, networking, and save/load are optional.
